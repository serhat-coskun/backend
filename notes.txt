1- Create an app: python3 manage.py startapp <appname>

2- Add the app to INSTALLED_APPS list in the setup.py

For the app named xyz: add xyz.apps.XyzConfig
Note that xyz uses camel case this is the name of app config class in the xyz.apps file.


3-  Note that we need 4 files for fully functional page service

.. model.py : define db models
.. views.py : using models.py and template.html services the page
.. template.html : defines html to be rendered by views with data from models
.. urls.py : connects a url to views.py view


4- If we are developing a static web page, we do not need to use models


5- Create a valid view using models.py and template html, following 3 techniqes:
	.. function based, returns a rendered template
	.. view class based
	.. generic view class based

6- Bind view with a url, in the myAppName/urls.py which we will create
   Note we will use django.urls.path and need to import our views to access view   function or class.
   
   Using path(route, viewFunction or Class, name =<Name>)
   route is a regular expression
   while naming prefer names appName-name so that url name's does not clash

7- Need to include app url.py into project url.py
   Need django.urls.include
   Using:


   path("", include("appname.urls"))

8- Project urls.py is a gateway to each apps urls.py
